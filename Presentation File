## Introduction**

* "Hi everyone, we’re Team StudyArena."
* "Students today study from long PDFs, dense textbooks, and messy notes — and most of that studying is passive and boring."
* "We wanted to turn studying into something interactive, fast, and actually enjoyable."

## The Problem**

* "Whether it's exams, quizzes, or midterms, students waste hours reading PDFs without retaining information."
* "There’s no tool that instantly converts *your own study material* into an active learning experience."
* "So we decided to fix that."

## The Solution — StudyArena**

* "StudyArena transforms any uploaded PDF into interactive learning games."
* "We extract the text locally, send it to our n8n workflow, and generate MCQs, flashcards, fill-in-the-blanks, and mini-quizzes — all based on your PDF."
* "It’s instant, personalized, and helps you learn much faster."
